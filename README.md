# Giftastic!

Giftastic is an interface to search and display results from the Giphy API. The project will show the first 10 results for any topic-based search. 

## Access this tool in two ways. 
First, copy and past this URL into your browser: https://kglibrarian.github.io/giftastic/
Or you can download the items in github (index.html and the assets folder) and save in a folder called giftastic (or any name you choose). 

## How to use the tool. 
Enter a search term (or terms) into the search box. Click the submit button. A new button should appear with your search term on it. Click on the new button, and 10 gifs should appear related to that topic. There will be a rating underneath each of the gifs. 

## Maintaining this tool. 
This tool was created as part of a Web Development Bootcamp at Northwestern University. Please contact Karen Gutzman if you need any assistance.
